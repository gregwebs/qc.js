- restructure the listener architecture, to have all data available in the listeners failure, success, etc. functions
  right now there are only strings passed, that is very unpleasent
- create a nice html listener
- create a Listener, that converts intentionally failing tests into passing results, so we can selftest failures
- include jasmine or alike, to do the real unit testing
